# layout-bootstrap-bem
I found this layout at Google. I try to make it as good as I can. 
I need to add 3 blocks of a carousel.
And also make it adaptive.
I will finish this project after learning the basics of JavaScript!
If you will find mistakes or something useful — tell me, please.
I am still a newbie.
